### The site
This site consists of short posts about things I've learned and find useful.

### Me
I am a Senior Software Engineer at Applied Research Associates, Inc. in Raleigh, NC.  I work on a variety of distributed computing projects utilizing Apache Spark and other compute platforms / frameworks. I have a great deal of experience with very large databases (SQL Server and Postgresql) as well as setting up and running applications out on Amazon's AWS utilizing their EC2 compute resources.

I have also developed many REST based APIs and web applications on both Linux and Windows platforms.

Most recently I have been doing a lot of DevOps style work in the field of automation, deployment, and clustering out on AWS and private cloud infrastructure with Docker, Swarm, CoreOS, and RancherOS.

Have a great day!
