### The site
This site consists of short posts about things I've learned and find useful.

### Me
I am a Senior Software Engineer at Applied Research Associates, Inc., and have created a variety of distributed computing products utilizing Apache Spark and other high-performance computing platforms.  I have experience designing, and developing very large databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Apache Drill) as well as developing, maintaining, and running applications on Amazonâ€™s AWS utilizing their EC2 compute resources and web services.  

I have also developed many REST based APIs and web applications on both Linux and Windows.  Most recently, I have been tasked with a variety of DevOps work - including building, orchestrating, and monitoring Docker container-based systems on a variety of implementations ranging from local clusters to AWS based infrastructure. 

Have a great day!
